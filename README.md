# Image classification
I undertook the task of classifying flower species from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in conjunction with TensorFlow's pre-trained models. The objective was to develop an accurate and robust flower classification system to aid botanists and enthusiasts in identifying various flower species efficiently.

## Data Collection and Augmentation:
I started by assembling a comprehensive dataset comprising images of different flower species from diverse sources. To enhance the dataset's diversity and improve model generalization, I employed data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and shifting. These transformations expanded the dataset size and introduced variations in lighting, orientation, and perspective, thereby enriching the model's ability to generalize across different conditions.

## Model Development:
For the CNN architecture, I utilized TensorFlow's pre-trained models, specifically InceptionV3 or MobileNet, as they offer excellent performance and efficiency in image classification tasks. Leveraging transfer learning, I initialized the model with weights pre-trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet. This allowed the model to capture generic features from the pre-trained layers and fine-tune them to recognize specific flower species in our dataset. I replaced the final classification layer with a custom output layer tailored to the number of flower species in our dataset.

## Training and Evaluation:
The model was trained on the augmented dataset using stochastic gradient descent with a suitable learning rate and momentum. During training, I monitored performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and validation accuracy to gauge the model's progress and prevent overfitting. To evaluate the model's performance, I utilized a separate test set, measuring metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its classification accuracy and robustness.
