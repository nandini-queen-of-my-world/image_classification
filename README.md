# Image classification
I developed a flower image classification system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow's pre-trained models. The project aimed to streamline the identification of various flower species, benefiting botanists and enthusiasts alike. To create a robust dataset, I collected images of different flower species from various sources and applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to augment the dataset's diversity. Leveraging transfer learning, I utilized pre-trained models like InceptionV3 or MobileNet to initialize the CNN architecture, enabling efficient feature extraction and fine-tuning for flower classification. During training, I monitored performance metrics like accuracy and loss to ensure model convergence and prevent overfitting. The resulting model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying flower species, showcasing the efficacy of CNNs and pre-trained models in image classification tasks. This project not only provided a valuable tool for rapid species identification but also highlighted the potential of deep learning techniques in botanical research and conservation efforts.
